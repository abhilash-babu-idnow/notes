<ul>
<li>Case Study 1
<ul>
<li>Time magazine reported that Yale graduates of year 1924 make an average salary of 25k$. Can this number be trusted?
<ul>
<li>Is the sample population truely represent the population</li>
<li>Whose addresses did they have?</li>
<li>Did they tell the truth?</li>
<li>Students who didnt make get into good jobs, might not have been available for the suvey</li>
<li>In short, most of the statistics one comes across in daily life is either biased or too small to represent the population or both.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Case Study 2
<ul>
<li>Survey of two magazines readership. One a gossip magazine and other a more intellectual one.</li>
<li>When people were asked which magazine do they read, an overwhelming number of people voted for the intellectual one. But the actual readership numbers were more for the gossip magazine.</li>
<li>Long story short, people can lie during surveys.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The result of a sampling study is no better than the sample it is based on.</p>
