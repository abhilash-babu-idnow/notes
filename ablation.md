> **Dictionary meaning**:
> Ablation - the removal of organs, abnormal growths, or harmful substances from the body by mechanical means like surgery / reduction in volume of glacial ice due to melting, evaporation etc / erosion of protective outer surface of a spacecraft or missile due to aero dynamic heating. 


In the context of deep learning / machine learning, this term gained popularity after a tweet from the author of Keras framework, Francois Chollet: 

> Ablation studies are crucial for deep learning research -- can't stress this enough. Understanding causality in your system is the most straightforward way to generate reliable knowledge (the goal of any research). And ablation is a very low-effort way to look into causality.

> If you take any complicated deep learning experimental setup, chances are you can remove a few modules (or replace some trained features with random ones) with no loss of performance. Get rid of the noise in the research process: do ablation studies.

 > Can't fully understand your system? Many moving parts? Want to make sure the reason it's working is really related to your hypothesis? Try removing stuff. Spend at least ~10% of your experimentation time on an honest effort to disprove your thesis.
