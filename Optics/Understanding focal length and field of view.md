Summary from [Focal length blog on Edmund Optics website](https://www.edmundoptics.eu/knowledge-center/application-notes/imaging/understanding-focal-length-and-field-of-view) [[Optics]]

#PrimeLens is a fixed focal length lens. (unifocal length / FFL - fixed focal length)
- Maximum aperture from f2.8 to f1.2
- Has a fixed angular field of view #AFOV
- A wide aperture provides a shallow depth of field (but why?)

![[focal_length_afov.png]]

- Three ways to change the field of view
	- Move the lens farther away from the object plane, increases the field of view
	- Use a different lens (one with a different focal length)
	- Use a different sensor size.

#ZoomLens 


#AFOV 

$$AFOV = 2 {\times} tan^{-1}\frac{h}{2f}$$

where *f* is the focal length and *h* is the horizontal dimension of the sensor. 

#Hyperfocal_Distance [[Optics]]
**Hyperfocal Distance** 
- Distance beyond which all the objects can be brought into an acceptable focus.
- Distance giving the maximum depth of field.
