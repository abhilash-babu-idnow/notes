<p>Notes from the book “Version Control by Example” by Eric Sink.</p>
<p>At the start of the book he identifies 18 tasks which are basic to any version control system. They are as following. 1. Create - Create a new empty repository He uses a really nice analogy of a file system being a 2D space of files and directories and repository being a 3D space created by from filesystem by adding a time component. 2. Checkout - Creating a working copy (a snap shot of the repository used bz the user to make changes). It will usually contain metadata too (timestamp , version number of the repository and may be a copy of the file for purpose of showing a diff.) 3. Commit - Apply the modifications to the repository.</p>
