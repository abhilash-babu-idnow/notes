<pre><code>    - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Responding to change over following a plan</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Anything substantive that you leave until later won’t happen, won’t happen well or will grow and become unmanageable. Continous development, not episodic. Tackle small problems when they are still small.</p></li>
<li><p>Agile development uses feedback to make constant adjustments in a highly collaborative environment.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="beginning-agility">Beginning agility</h2>
<h3 id="work-for-outcome">Work for outcome</h3>
<pre><code>- Fixing the problem is top priority and not what and who caused the problem. 
- Blame doesn&#39;t fix bugs. 
- Instead of pointing figures point to possible solutions. 
- Agile teams value outcome over process
- Measuring compliance to process doesn&#39;t measure outcome.</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="quickfix-becomes-quicksand">Quickfix becomes quicksand</h3>
<pre><code>*  Each quick fix will pile up and eventually the code base becomes a landmine
*  Don&#39;t code in isolation (bus factor), code reviews, collective ownership.
*  Use unit tests. 
*  Invest energy to keep code clean and out in the open
*  You need to understand how a piece of code works but no need to become an expert. 
*  Fix the problem not the symptom ( +1/-1 syndrome)</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="criticize-ideas-not-people">Criticize ideas, not people</h3>
<pre><code>* Ask a leading question that allows someone to figure out the problem themselves. 
* **Negativity kills innovation**
* All have some good ideas and some bad ideas and everyone in the team should feel free to express them. 
* &gt;You don&#39;t have to be great to get started but you need to get started to be great -- Les Brown. 
* Being unemotional doesn&#39;t mean to blindly accept all ideas but to choose the right words and reasons to explain why the idea doesn&#39;t fit and ask clarifying questions. </code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="damn-the-torpedoes-go-ahead">Damn the Torpedoes, Go ahead</h3>
<pre><code>* You have been asked to fix some code written by someone else and it is very difficult to understand. Should you leave it in a mess or inform your boss that it should be removed? Show and reason about why the code should be rewritten. 
* If you implement something incorrectly. Should you cover up the issue or standup and ask for time/help and suggest ideas to fix? Latter as you will not only have a proper solution you will earn the trust of the team. 
* Do what&#39;s right. Be honest and have the courage to communicate the truth. It may be difficlut at times. 
* Don&#39;t start rejecting and rewriting simply because you can&#39;t understand rightaway. That&#39;s not courage, its impatience. </code></pre>

<h3 id="keeping-up-with-change">Keeping up with change</h3>
<pre><code>    - Technology changes very fast and it is our responsibility to keep up.
    - Learn iteratively and incrementally, allocate daily some time for study.
    - Get the latest buzz from the internet, mailing lists, twitter feeds etc
    - Improve networking by participating in local meetups.
    - Attend conferences. 
    - Read books.</code></pre>
<h3 id="know-when-to-unlearn">Know when to Unlearn</h3>
<pre><code>    - Like learning new stuff it is equally important to let go old techniques which are not relevant. 
    - Example compilers now are very efficient and smart and can do optimization way better. So no point in doing the optimization like loop unrolling etc by hand. One should just leave it to the compoiler to sort it out.</code></pre>
<hr />
<h2 id="agile-feedback">Agile Feedback</h2>
<h3 id="put-angels-on-your-shoulders">Put Angels on Your Shoulders</h3>
<pre><code>    - Coding feedback through testing. 
    - Automate the unit tests.</code></pre>

<h3 id="actively-evaluate-trade-offs">Actively evaluate trade offs</h3>
<h2 id="todo">- todo</h2>
<h3 id="code-in-increments">Code in increments</h3>
<pre><code>    - Write code in short edit build test cycles
    - Helps to refine and structure the code better.
    - Refactor the code as well as the tests.</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="keep-it-simple">Keep it simple</h3>
<pre><code>    - Try to make the design as simple as possible.
    - Don&#39;t try to use patterns and principle just for the sake of using them. 
    - &quot;A good design makes you feel comfortable&quot;
    - Terse is not simple. 
    - What is simple might not be simple for others. </code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="write-cohesive-code">Write Cohesive code</h3>
<pre><code>    - High cohesion and low coupling. Software architecture 101.
    - A module should have only one reason to change.
    - Don&#39;t take it too far with breaking down code into components just to satisfy the rule of each component doing just one thing. </code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="tell-dont-ask">Tell Don’t Ask</h3>
<pre><code>    - Command Query Separation
    - Categorize the functions as either commands and queries. 
    - Queries should be side effect free
    - Command changes the state of the objet. </code></pre>

<pre><code>    - todo</code></pre>

<h2 id="agile-debugging">Agile Debugging</h2>

<h2 id="agile-colaboration">Agile Colaboration</h2>
<pre><code>    - Team work, self organization and communication is essential for the success of the project. 
    - Face to face communication 
    - Collective ownership
    - Architects must code too. 
    - Code reviews.
    - Share knowledge, be a mentor.</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="schedule-regular-face-time">Schedule regular face time</h3>
<pre><code>    - Daily standup meeting and if its a small team may be every other day. 
    - What did I achieve yesterday? What I am planning to do today? What is in my way? Neither too detailed and low lever nor too high level and abstract.
    - Limit it to two to three minutes and take it offline if more discussion is needed.
    - Helps to start the day in a focussed way, effecitve resource allocation and to actively seek help to fix problems.
    - Helps team members know what everyone is working on, motivates one another, find redundancies and share ideas and knowledge.</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="architects-must-write-code.">Architects must write code.</h3>
<pre><code>    - Good design evolves from active programmers. 
    - Encourage programmers to design. Or a senior developer should do it or pair up developers to do the design. 
    - Powerpoint architects wouldn&#39;t help. Design in isloation won&quot;t work. </code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="practices-collective-ownership">Practices Collective Ownership</h3>
<pre><code>    - Multiple people working on same piece of code =&gt; automatically gets reviewed. 
    - Scheduling becomes easy as multiple people are comfortable with the code. 
    - When a particular module needs expert knowledge then it doesn&#39;t make sense to rotate the developers for that modules. Too many cooks.
    - Collective Ownership != Hack wildly.</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="be-a-mentor">Be a Mentor</h3>
<pre><code>    - Knowledge grows when given.
