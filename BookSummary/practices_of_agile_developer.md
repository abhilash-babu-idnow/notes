> Agile Manifesto
>  * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
>  * Working software over comprehensive documentation
>  * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
>  * Responding to change over following a plan

> Anything substantive that you leave until later won't happen, won't happen well or will grow and become unmanageable. Continous development, not episodic. Tackle small problems when they are still small. 

> Agile development uses feedback to make constant adjustments in a highly collaborative environment. 

* Work for outcome
	* Fixing the problem is top priority and not what and who caused the problem. Blame doesn't fix bugs. Instead of pointing figures point to possible solutions. 
	* Agile teams value outcome over process
	* Measuring compliance to process doesn't measure outcome.
*  Quickfix becomes quicksand
	*  Each quick fix will pile up and eventually the code base becomes a landmine
	*  Don't code in isolation (bus factor), code reviews, collective ownership.
	*  Use unit tests. 
	*  Invest energy to keep code clean and out in the open
