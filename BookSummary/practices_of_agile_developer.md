> Agile Manifesto
>  * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
>  * Working software over comprehensive documentation
>  * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
>  * Responding to change over following a plan

> Anything substantive that you leave until later won't happen, won't happen well or will grow and become unmanageable. Continous development, not episodic. Tackle small problems when they are still small. 

> Agile development uses feedback to make constant adjustments in a highly collaborative environment. 

## Beginning agility
* Work for outcome
	* Fixing the problem is top priority and not what and who caused the problem. Blame doesn't fix bugs. Instead of pointing figures point to possible solutions. 
	* Agile teams value outcome over process
	* Measuring compliance to process doesn't measure outcome.
*  Quickfix becomes quicksand
	*  Each quick fix will pile up and eventually the code base becomes a landmine
	*  Don't code in isolation (bus factor), code reviews, collective ownership.
	*  Use unit tests. 
	*  Invest energy to keep code clean and out in the open
	*  You need to understand how a piece of code works but no need to become an expert. 
	*  Fix the problem not the symptom ( +1/-1 syndrome)
* Criticize ideas, not people
	* Ask a leading question that allows someone to figure out the problem themselves. 
	* **Negativity kills innovation**
	* All have some good ideas and some bad ideas and everyone in the team should feel free to express them. 
	* >You don't have to be great to get started but you need to get started to be great -- Les Brown. 
	* Being unemotional doesn't mean to blindly accept all ideas but to choose the right words and reasons to explain why the idea doesn't fit and ask clarifying questions. 
* Damn the Torpedoes, Go ahead
	* You have been asked to fix some code written by someone else and it is very difficult to understand. Should you leave it in a mess or inform your boss that it should be removed? Show and reason about why the code should be rewritten. 
	* If you implement something incorrectly. Should you cover up the issue or standup and ask for time/help and suggest ideas to fix? Latter as you will not only have a proper solution you will earn the trust of the team. 
	* Do what's right. Be honest and have the courage to communicate the truth. It may be difficlut at times. 
	* Don't start rejecting and rewriting simply because you can't understand rightaway. That's not courage, its impatience.
