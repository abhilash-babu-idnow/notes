- Start with a product backlog 
- Work is done in a short time boxed iterations
- Each iteration (Sprint) can be between a week to one month long.
- At the start of the iteration we choose the most important features that could be done in the sprint (Iteration Planning / Spring Planning)
- At the end of the iteration the team and Product Owner review the Sprint and based on the feedback from the review the next iteration / sprint is planned.
- At the end of the iteration there should be potentially a shippable product. It is also possible to group the outcome of a couple of sprints into a release.
