# Part 1 - What and Why?

> MLOps vs ModelOps vs AIOps
> __MLOps__ and __ModelOps__ are the same, but some might argue that __ModelOps__ is bit more generic in the sense that it also includes rule based models in addition to the ML models. __AIOps__ is a different thing altogether and deals with using AI for operations like AI for Devops solviing problems like predictive maintenance, predicting newtork failures etc in advance. 

### Definition and Challenges
- It is the standardization and streamlining of the Machine learning life cycle management.

Challenges 

- Changing Business needs and Changing Data. It is important to make sure that the model represents the actual Business requirements. 
- Different tools and language is used by Business Leaders, Data scientists, Analysts, Data Engineers, DevOps engineers etc. 
- Data scientists have to often juggle between many roles and often end up with maintaining and deploying a lot of models and sometime models that they didn't even develop. The whole situation then become very complex and chaotic.

### Subject Matter Experts
- ML Model life cycle starts and ends with Subject Matter Experts
- Define Business goals, questions and KPIs (Key performance Indidcators)
- Without inputs from SMEs the models developed by Data Scientits might not bring a lot of value to the business
- Which would lead to less business outcomes which would mean that there wouldn't be more budget for ML projects
