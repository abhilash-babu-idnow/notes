Notes from the book "Version Control by Example" by Eric Sink.

At the start of the book he identifies 18 tasks which are basic to any version control system. They are as following.
1. Create - Create a new empty repository
He uses a really nice analogy of a file system being a 2D space of files and directories and repository being a 3D space created by from filesystem by adding a time component.
2. Checkout - Creating a working copy (a snap shot of the repository used bz the user to make changes). It will usually contain metadata too (timestamp , version number of the repository and may be a copy of the file for purpose of showing a diff.)
3. Commit - Apply the modifications to the repository.
