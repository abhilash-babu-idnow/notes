### Annotations
Textual information to complement the pictorial senteces - refers to the changes, exceptions or possible errors - can be associated with actors, work objects or activities, whole sentences or group of sentences and whole domain - In the context of whole domain, annotations help set up the context or scene - lets u answer the questions like what is the story about? why is it relevant? what are the constraints etc. - annotations about the whole domain are either put at the margins or at the bottom of the story
