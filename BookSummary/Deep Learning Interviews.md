__Problems__

- For a fixed number of observations in a data set, introducing more variables normally generates a model that has a better fit to the data. What may be the drawback of such a model fitting strategy?

> _True_ 

*However, when an excessive and unnecessary number of variables is used in a logistic regression model, it might over fit. It is important that a logistic regression model does not start training with more variables than is justified for the given number of observations.*

- Define the term "odds of success" both qualitatively and fomally. Give a numerical example that stresses the relations between probability and odds of an event occuring.c
