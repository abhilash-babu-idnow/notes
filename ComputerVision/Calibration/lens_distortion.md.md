Three types

* Radial Distortion
* Decentering Distortion
* Thin prism Distortion

Radial Distortion -> Barrel Distortion
							 -> Pincussion Distortion
							 
Radial Distortion Modelling

* Brown Model
	* Works well with small distortions
* Fitzgibbon Model
	* Works with both small and large distortions
	* Better results with lower order polynomials
