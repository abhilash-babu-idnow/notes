<p>ML defenition - &gt; Programming computers to learn from data</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Field of study that gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data Mining -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Applying machine learning techniques to dig into large amounts of data to find patterns that are not immediately apparent.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Why ML?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better than the traditional approach.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ML based approaches can be automated for adapting to change. eg. spam filtering. ML algo could be updated to flag spam emails based on the feedback data from the users. Thus when user flags an email as spam the ML algorithm could find the patterns and words in such emails and update itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Complex tasks such as speach recognition is easier to tackle using ML algorithms than to hardcode an algorithm that would find features in the speach signal as it will not scale.</p>
