% How to lie with Statistics

# Chapter 1 - The Sample with Built-in Bias

- Case Study 1 
	- Time magazine reported that Yale graduates of year 1924 make an average salary of 25k$. Can this number be trusted?
		- Is the sample population truely represent the population
		- Whose addresses did they have?
		- Did they tell the truth?
		- Students who didnt make get into good jobs, might not have been available for the suvey
		- In short, most of the statistics one comes across in daily life is either biased or too small to represent the population or both. 
- Case Study 2
	- Survey of two magazines readership. One a gossip magazine and other a more intellectual one. 
	- When people were asked which magazine do they read, an overwhelming number of people voted for the intellectual one. But the actual readership numbers were more for the gossip magazine.
	- Long story short, people can lie during surveys. 

> The result of a sampling study is no better than the sample it is based on.
