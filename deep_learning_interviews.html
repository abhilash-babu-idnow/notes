<hr />
<p><strong>Chapter 1</strong> - Mainly talks about the structure of the book and the kind of problems available in the book. - The approach to take to read the book. - Intended audience etc.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Chapter 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For a fixed number of observations in a data set, introducing more variables normally generates a model that has a better fit to the data. What may be the drawback of such a model fitting strategy?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>True</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>However, when an excessive and unnecessary number of variables is used in a logistic regression model, it might over fit. It is important that a logistic regression model does not start training with more variables than is justified for the given number of observations.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Define the term “odds of success” both qualitatively and fomally. Give a numerical example that stresses the relations between probability and odds of an event occuring.c</li>
</ul>
