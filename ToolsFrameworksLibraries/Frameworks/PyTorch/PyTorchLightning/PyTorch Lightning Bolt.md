> Bolts is a Deep learning research and production toolbox of:
> - SOTA pretrained models.
> - Model components.
> - Callbacks.
> - Losses.
> - Datasets.
    

> **The Main goal of Bolts is to enable trying new ideas as fast as possible!**
All models are tested (daily), benchmarked, documented and work on CPUs, TPUs, GPUs and 16-bit precision.
