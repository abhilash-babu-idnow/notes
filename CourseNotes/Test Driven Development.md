# Chapter 1 - What is TDD
- idea from Kent Beck.
- Three rules of TDD
	- *You shall not write any production code, unless required by a failing Unit test*
	- *You shall not write more of a unit test, than is required to fail*
	- *You shall not write more production code ,than is sufficient to make the one failing test pass*
- Red Green Refactor
	- Red - Write a failing test case
	- Green - Make the test pass
	- Refactor - Improve the design of the code without changing its behaviour
