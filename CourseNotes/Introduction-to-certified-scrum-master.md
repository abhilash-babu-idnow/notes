### Agile Methodologies

	- Scrum
	
		Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.
		
		Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. Scrum co-creators Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland have written [The Scrum Guide](http://www.scrumguides.org/) to explain Scrum clearly and succinctly.  This Guide contains the definition of Scrum. This definition consists of Scrum’s accountabilities, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together. 
		
		The **Scrum** framework focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial emphasis on software, and hardware, based development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called _sprints_, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to demonstrate the work done, and sprint retrospective to improve continuously.

	- Lean
		Lean is an agile framework that promotes an incremental flow of work to the customer. Lean promotes visualizations of work status, and working with small tasks. Lean prescribes focusing on a core set of tasks in a flow environment and completing them. This process then repeats. Lean has 7 principles :			
			-   Eliminate waste: Review the value chain and eliminate wait time			    
			-   Build quality in : Test all features that are built			    
			-   Create **knowledge:** Train workers and take on challenges.			    
			-   Deliver fast: Work with tasks that are as small as possible and get them done			    
			-   **Respect** people: People do the work
			-   Optimize the whole: Work with the complete solution that is deliverable to the customer, not the solution components.
			
	- TDD
	
	- XP
		is an Agile methodology which is intended to improve product quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. XP it advocates frequent "releases" in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted. Other elements of extreme programming include: programming in small batches, pair programing, extensive code review, and automated and manual unit testing of all code. XP also prescribes continuous integration of code. Integration is a difficult activity. However, if it is done continuously, in small batches the difficulty is reduced.
